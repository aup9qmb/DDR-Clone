# DDR-Clone

```
I shall be telling this with a sigh
Somewhere ages and ages hence:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€”
I took the one not traveled by,
```

## Building

### External Dependencies

CS50 codespace has all of these included, and others are statically linked.

- cmake
- clang
- libwayland-dev
- libxkbcommon-dev
- xorg-dev
- mesa-common-dev
- libx11-dev
- libxrandr-dev
- libxi-dev xorg-dev


`$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aup9qmb/DDR-Clone.git`\
`$ cd DDR-Clone && make`

The game binary, once built with `$ make`, can be found in `./bin/`.

Run with `$ ./bin/game` or `$ make run` out of the root directory of the repository.[^1]

[^1]: Fear of failure may be a poor reason not to try, but try and fail both I did.
