test out PySDL2 without actually installing it. You just need to set up your PYTHONPATH to point to the location of the source distribution package.

On Linux/Unix, use

$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/pysdl2:$PYTHONPATH

for bourne shell compatibles or

setenv PYTHONPATH /path/to/pysdl2:$PYTHONPATH

for C shell compatibles. You can omit the :$PYTHONPATH, if you did not use it so far and if your environment settings do not define it.

=======================

If you require compiled (c-extension) modules like SciPy, we recommend you use conda and pypy3.9, which works on Windows10, macOS, and linux x86_64. You can read more about this in the blog post.

 conda create -c conda-forge -n my_cool_pypy pypy python=3.9

 conda activate my_cool_pypy

 conda install scipy
